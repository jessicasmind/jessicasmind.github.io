## Hi, I'm Jessica.
I have worked in e-commerce for over ten years, creating written and visual content for retail websites, as well as freelance web design. Born and raised in Seattle, WA, I earned my BA from Seattle University. I later relocated to New York City and earned my MFA in creative writing at Hunter College. Back home again, I recently completed the Professional Technical Writing program at the University of Washington.
